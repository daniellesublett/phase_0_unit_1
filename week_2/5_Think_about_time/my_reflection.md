# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
  Not giving in to distraction! I've noticed that with challenges that are more difficult, my first instinct is to just RUN AWAY, head straight to facebook or twitter and see if anyone said anything interesting in the last 5 minutes (they didn't. they never do.) This head for the hills knee-jerk reaction has been my biggest hurdle. 

* How will you combat that? 
  I've been trying out the pomodoro technique, and that seems to be working really well. Knowing that I have a 5 minute break coming up soon decreases the anxiety that makes me want to run from the problem. The best feeling is having the timer go off and thinking "what? already?!"

* What techniques will you try?
  Applying the tiny habits. I'm going to start trying this: After I write a few lines of code that I found difficult, I will stop and read the code aloud line by line and explain to myself (again, out loud) what each line is doing and why. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
  To really dive into the challenges and LEARN instead of just trying to get "the right answer" I want to UNLEARN the habit of completing an assignment just to have it done and over with, and I want to focus on having enough respect for myself and the material by taking my time, reviewing, practicing and chipping away at anything that is intimidating. I tend to get really discouraged if I don't "get" something right away, there's a massive block caused by self-consciousness. So, tldr; my plan for Phase 0 is to embrace the not-knowing-it-all so I can start learning!
