Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

Despite having the actual definition in the acronym, it took me awhile to realize that the DOM is a MODEL of the DOCUMENT made up of OBJECTS. Any HTML element is an example of an object. Good because it can store page content that can be accessed and changed by a script (like Javascript), one downside is that though there are standards for the DOM, it can greatly differ depending on what browser you are using.

How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

I hadn't applies any styling to my index site yet, so of course there was a lot more to see when looking at a wordpress site (I used http://www.harveynichols.com/) One thing that surprised me was seeing how many scripts were in the body of the html. I though it was best practice to keep them in the head? The wordpress site had quite a few slideshows and bells and whistles, not all of which seemed necessary. 

Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Seeing how I could save changes to my file (by overwriting) directly from the dev tools was very cool. Now I just have to try it 100 times so that I remember that this feature exists! Troubleshooting the Javascript was also fun, even though some of the code school challenges were a little over my head. 

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

None this time around! There was so much material to review!
