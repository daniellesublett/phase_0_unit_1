# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://daniellesublett.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
  That design has a huge impact on usability. Some rules of print design, whitespace for example, apply, but not all. Getting into the nitty gritty about how grids and typography affect flow was interesting.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
 As you'll be able to see from the my_wireframe file, I bit of waaaay more than I could chew. I wanted to include every trick I'd learned (and even some that I still haven't quite got the hang of). I had to simplify the actual construction of the coded index site. 


* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
  I spent a lot of time looking at Wordpress templates, taking notes on what I liked. Wireframing is getting easier, but it's hard not to go overboard sketching out elements I wanted to include but didn't quite know how to execute. For example, who knew it was SO HARD to get a background image on a responsive site? Seems like it should be simple, but after a couple frustrating hours I ended up going with a tried and true (and very very boring) grey gradient.


* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
  I'd like the "previews" of the projects listed on the index site to be automatically generated when I add the url! I'd also like to figure out how to get a background image in the header.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
  Learning to create a responsive grid was both the most difficult and the most rewarding challenge this week. Once my pair and I got it working it was such a victory! 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  Did I mention I LOVE gradients? http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
