# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
  They are good. Very good. Necessary even. Just as long as these standards evlove with the technology and are updated accordingly, and just as long as those standards are ultimately customizable

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
  The standard default structure does make sense at a basic level, just like a basic wordpress template makes sense. Less choices to make, but the aesthetics and the functionality might not be exactly what the developer has oin mind. 

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
  Yes! It's much more specific and intuitive than naming everything 'div'

* Why is reset.css necessary?
  reset.css resets the default styles of some html tags, allowing you to customize things like unordered lists (if you don't want the default bullet points). 
   
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
   Chrome mostly. But every once in awhile I'll take a look at IE6 to remind myself that sites can look completely different. And by different I mean worse. Really bad, actually. I don't necessarily see this as a "good" or "bad" thing, persay. Just inevitable as each browser tailors service to their users.
