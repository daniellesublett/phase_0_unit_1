# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design is a set of techniques for creating websites that display differently depending on which device (screensize) you are viewing them on without creating a different site for each device. I think it's a good practice because it streamlines the process of making sure a site is usable and accessible by different devices, and that you only have one site that is consistent accross the board.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Smartphones and tablets have made it clear that piecemeal design catering to a specific device is no longer practical, and that accessibility, readablity and design play a huge part in how we interact with a site. It's easy enough to say that the screens will only continue to get bigger AND smaller, but I think there is a high possibility that the next "display" won't be a screen at all. How will web design change when our browser window is contained in a contact lense for example? 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

Access to information is a fundamental human right. Visually impaired people who navigate the web via audio cues are just as capable of being annoyed by bad user design as anyone else! Designing for accessibility presents a really interesting challenge. Navigation, selection, and layout all have to be considered in a completely different way. Organization and empathy are key when deciding what makes an intuitive and intelligent tag.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

Responsive design and the issues surrounding accessiblity are, I think, prime examples of the "work smarter, not harder" approach. Although it might seem to make sense to design a seperate site for the visually impaired, or a seperate mobile version of a site, building a single site with these issues in mind is a more integral and well-thought-out strategy. One thing that seems really daunting is the rate at which technology is changing. How can we establish standards and best practices when things are changing so fast?
