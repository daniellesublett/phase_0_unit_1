What 2 new things did you learn about the web?

I always thought of Java Script as another object oriented language, but accoring to this slide: http://girldevelopit.com/assets/web-concepts/index.html#/12 it's "written procedurally." It was also interesting to learn that there are HUNDREDS of web browsers. It would be interesting to research lesser known, cool obscure browsers that I probably have never heard of. 

What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?

It's important to remember that HTML is just the "mark up", and that it's CSS that makes it pretty, and Javascript that makes it functional (beyond just clicking links to go to other pages) 

How did you feel when you saw your web page live?

Same feeling as when I start writing in a new notebook or painting on a new canvass! Full of potential, but also full of potential mistakes. 

Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Though the DNS article was long, it was really helpful in demystifying some of the things that go on behind the scenes when you're creating or moving a website. At previous non-tech jobs, this has always been a scary process, and I never was able to adequately describe what was going on. 

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

This might even be included in later lessons already, but after attending a GDI weekend class in Intro to Web Development, I've consistently used these slides as a quick reference: http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10998095/htmlcss-1day/index.html
