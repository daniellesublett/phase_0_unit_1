What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them? 

Floats were (and still are) a bit tricky to understand. Same with the concepts of absolute and relative positioning. I used this handy sheet for reference http://overapi.com/css/ I also used the Mozilla docs linked to in the sheet to get a deeper explanation of concepts that were hard to understand. 

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
The image div with the caption! Still haven't quite figured it out, so I will just have to keep fiddling around until I get it right! Maybe I'll try including captioed divs in the blog exercise. Sussing out the sidebar was more rewarding!

Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
Pseudo selectors were fun to play around with. Took a few tries to get it working, but now I feel like I have a useful tool.

How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
I'm comfortable "using HTML tags to present information on a website" but I definitely need more practice with positioning. I'm very comfortable with the concepts of margin, padding, etc. but "relative" and "absolute" are still not locked down.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
Designing and coding my own site! It's always fun when you feel like you have control over every element.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Troubleshooting. But that can be both tedious AND fun. Sometimes I would get distracted switching from the css to the html and forget what I was trying to do!
