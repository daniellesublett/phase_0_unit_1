Blog url: http://daniellesublett.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

It was fun to review sites that I had to use every day at my last job. No comments or views yet. The process was difficult, but helpful! I liked being given free range with the design, and I'd like to revisit and refine it at some point.
