Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

After trying so hard for years trying to learn on my own, I'm really convinced I made the right decision in participating in DBC. Everyone is scared, nervous, excited, and very driven. It's a really refreshing change to work through a problem and know that there is an entire community waiting to answer any question you might have. It also never occured to me that I could help someone else! Reading through the other blog posts really gave me a sense of community and eased many of my own fears.
