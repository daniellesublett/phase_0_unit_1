What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

One of the most difficult parts of setting up git and GitHub was navigating between the terminal and GitHub. They're such different ways of interacting with the computer, and at times it was tricky to grasp what part of the process needed to be done where. As I am becoming more comfortable with the terminal I realize that most GUI actions, select, move, save etc. have their equivalent commands in the terminal. I noticed that a couple of the articles in the reading called out the need for a definative git/GitHub flowchart. It would be fun to build one once I figure out what the heck is happening. 

Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 

Like Excel for spreadsheets or Word for written documents, git is software geared for a certain purpose, in this case version control. Instead of being limited to "undo" or "redo", git allows you to work on several versions of a file simultaneously and then "merge" your changes. It also allows several different people to work on a single file at once. GitHub is a social coding network that allows you to "push" (ie upload) your files and any changes to those files to an open source platform on the web using git. 

Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.

Version control allows you to bundle relevant changes to a file (a commit), allows you to work on several versions of the same file (branches), revert to an earlier version if something in your file breaks, and to merge different versions of your file and specifically track the changes. GitHub not only helps with tracking these changes, but also allows others to view your files, comment, and create their own versions that you have the option of merging. 

Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?

Developers use version control because it allows you to build code without the risk of breaking the last usable version of your file. It helps you keep track of when changes were made, what those changes were, and (if your commit messages are accurate and specific) why the changes were made. Since it also allows several versions of the same file to be worked on simultaneously, it's great for collaborating and trying out improvements or building a new feature of a site or app without making changes to the last version of the file that was working perfectly. The use of version control not only makes sense, but seems to be a pretty integral part of developing even a very simple project. Technology changes, and a file that works perfectly today will have to be updated at some point. 

What doesn't make sense? What does?

Does git live ONLY in the command line? Is these some friendlier, prettier way to initialize a commit, push a change up to GitHub etc.? Is there a GUI for git? I haven't played around with the GitHub app too much yet, so I might be answering my own question...
