Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person

In your GitHub account, click the repositories tab, then click the green "New" button.

The explanation of Wordpress was helpful in illustrating how an open source platform can still generate revenue with templates and customized plugins etc.

Even though most of this slideshow was over my head, it did include some handy flow charts explaining branching in git.
