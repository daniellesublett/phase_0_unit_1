What did you learn about design and user experience? 

I learned that many aspects of interactivity can actually start with just a simple sketch. It was interesting to see just how fully fleshed out a wireframe can get before even one line of code is written. 

Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe?

I really enjoyed working on the wireframe. It was a bit tricky to get the hang of Mockflow, lots of trial and error. Even though there was a bit of frustration, it was interesting to see it all come together. I realized that there really are "no accidents" when it comes to designing a commercial website. The items intended to draw the eye, the teeny tiny login/logout buttons, all things I never really noticed before even though I've visited these sites approximately a bazilliondy times.

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what? 

Seeing that there were SO MANY different ways of wireframing, from rough sketches to slick Illustrator files. It was a little intimidating looking through all the potential tools.

Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

Mockflow! So much easier than using Adobe Illustrator, although perhaps not as precise. 

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

Taking a look at my favorite sites through the eyes of a designer.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Doing it three times! I would have rather concentrated on just one site and made a more thorough and accurate wireframe. I would have learned just as much, perhaps even more.
