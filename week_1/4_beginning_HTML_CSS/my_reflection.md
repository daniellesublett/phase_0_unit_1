What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 

It's easy to see how tags manipulate the content, but it seems like there's still plenty of "styling" you can do using only html. Things like <em> or <strong> seem like they should be under CSS's domain. Are they just vestigial commands from a time when CSS wasn't the norm yet?

What seems good and bad about HTML?

Good: I like that it's a way to label your content for CSS. HTML forces you to be organized and think your content through and prepare for how you want it to be presented.

Bad: Remembering to close the tags! I know that lots of text editors have something built in to either actually do this, or at leas remind you to do this, but it still happens. 

Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I've been fiddling around with HTML and CSS for a couple years now, and at one point I was pretty fluent (ie I didn't have to look something up every time I wanted a certain style). My "aha" moment was realizing that I remembered absolutely nothing!
