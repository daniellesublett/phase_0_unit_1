// My role in the group is: Person 1, Tests to User Stories

// Here is my part of the challenge:

//There are 2 groups consisting of diferent numbers. 
//One group has an even amount of numbers, the other group has an odd amount of numbers.
//
// I need to get the sum of all the numbers in the group 
// that has an ODD amount of numbers.
// 
// Then I need to get the sum of all the numbers in the group 
// that has an EVEN amount of numbers. 
//
// Next I need the mean (average) of all the numbers in the 
// group that has an ODD amount of numbers. I'll also need the
// mean of the group that has an EVEN amount of numbers.
// 
// Lastly I need to find the median of the EVEN group, 
// and very lastly I need the median of the ODD group of numbers.
