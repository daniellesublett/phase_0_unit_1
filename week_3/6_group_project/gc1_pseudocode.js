// My role in the group is: Person 1 & 2, Tests to User Stories, and user stories into pseudocode

// Here is my part of the challenge:

//USER STORY
//There are 2 groups consisting of diferent numbers. 
//One group has an even amount of numbers, the other group has an odd amount of numbers.
//
////////////PSEUDOCODE
//////// We will be using two variables, evenLengthArray and oddLengthArray
// 
//USER STORY
// I need to get the sum of all the numbers in the group 
// that has an ODD amount of numbers.
//
////////////PSEUDOCODE
/////// We need a function, sum, where we do a "for" loop through the numbers in oddLengthArray and total them up, 
/////// then return the total.
// 
//USER STORY
// Then I need to get the sum of all the numbers in the group 
// that has an EVEN amount of numbers. 
//
////////////PSEUDOCODE
////// Using our sum function we created above, we need to do the same for the evenLengthArray. 
//
//USER STORY
// Next I need the mean (average) of all the numbers in the 
// group that has an ODD amount of numbers. I'll also need the
// mean of the group that has an EVEN amount of numbers.
//
////////////PSEUDOCODE
////// We need to do a "for" loop through the numbers, iterating 
////// through every number in oddArray and total them up, then return the total divided by the 
////// length of the array. Then we need to do the same (iterate, get the sum, divide the sum by the array length)
////// for the evenArray.
// 
//USER STORY
// Lastly I need to find the median of the EVEN group, 
// and very lastly I need the median of the ODD group of numbers.
//
////////////PSEUDOCODE
////// We need to sort oddLengthArray and EvenLengthArray and return the numbers at the CENTER
////// of the array for oddLengthArray. This means that we will need to pull the CENTER 2 from EvenLengthArray and average them.
